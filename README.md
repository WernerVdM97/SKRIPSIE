## This skripsie includes:
  - Feature extraction given a file containing n-grams with their counts
  - The target output is taken from a smoothed language model in ARPA format
  - Training of a neural network to produce a discounted probability for each n-gram
  - Rewriting these probabilties to an existing unsmoothed language model in ARPA format
  
 Other files included are examples of basic interactions with neural networks and language modeling
